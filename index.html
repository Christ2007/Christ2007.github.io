        <h3>Previus Experience</h3>
        <p> During my early years in the web development field, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that allowed me to develop practical and technical skills. I started by creating small websites for friends and acquaintances, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build user-friendly and responsive interfaces. This helped me understand the basics of web design and front-end development. Additionally, I collaborated with a small team to develop a website for a local startup, where I was responsible for integrating features such as contact forms, photo galleries, and login systems. Through these experiences, I learned how to write clean and structured code, and manage projects using version control systems like Git. These projects have provided me with a solid foundation to continue growing in the field of front-end development, with a particular focus on creating effective and modern user experiences</p>
