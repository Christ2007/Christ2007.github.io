    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Rome in 2007, I'm 17 years old. With this site, my intention was to show a bit of my skill to you. This website was made all in one day by me; I made the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to show the languages that I know the most. I also know PHP at a good level and a bit of Python and C++. As I said in the first page, I'm very passionate about this topic and I'm willing to learn everything. I'm also a great team worker and I can talk very easily to anyone. I'm young and I want to make some experience on camp before going to college and get my degree in computer engineering. I'm willing to put my whole self in my job and my instruction.</p>
